# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the maintainability and readability of the existing vanilla JavaScript To-Do List application by adding comprehensive inline documentation and structural comments. The goal is to make the codebase more accessible to developers who need to understand, modify, or extend the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive inline comments in the JavaScript code, so that I can quickly understand the purpose and functionality of each function and code block.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the JavaScript code THEN each function SHALL have a JSDoc-style comment block describing its purpose, parameters, and behavior
2. WHEN examining complex code sections THEN inline comments SHALL explain the logic and reasoning behind implementation decisions
3. WHEN looking at DOM manipulation code THEN comments SHALL clearly identify what elements are being modified and why
4. WHEN reviewing localStorage operations THEN comments SHALL explain the data structure and storage strategy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear structural comments in the HTML file, so that I can understand the layout organization and component relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the HTML structure THEN section comments SHALL clearly delineate major page areas (header, form, todo container)
2. WHEN examining form elements THEN comments SHALL explain their role in the application workflow
3. WHEN reviewing CSS class assignments THEN comments SHALL indicate the styling purpose where not obvious
4. WHEN looking at script and stylesheet links THEN comments SHALL explain their dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized comments in the CSS file, so that I can understand the styling approach and component organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the CSS file THEN section headers SHALL organize styles by component or functionality
2. WHEN examining complex selectors THEN comments SHALL explain the targeting strategy
3. WHEN looking at animations and transitions THEN comments SHALL describe the visual effects and timing
4. WHEN reviewing responsive design elements THEN comments SHALL explain breakpoint strategies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive code structure document, so that I can understand the overall architecture and file relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN needing to understand the application THEN a documentation file SHALL provide an overview of the architecture pattern
2. WHEN examining file relationships THEN documentation SHALL explain how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files interact
3. WHEN looking for specific functionality THEN documentation SHALL map features to their implementation locations
4. WHEN understanding data flow THEN documentation SHALL explain how user actions trigger code execution and storage updates
